    <h2>HOD, Department of Mathematics : Dr. S.K. Srivastava</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Department of Applied Physics was established in the year 2022 after the upgradation of Beant College of
        Engineering and Technology as Sardar Beant Singh State University. This department was created with a vision to
        strengthen the field of basic fundamental physics in the university. The strong base of the department has been
        built and nurtured by its well qualified current faculty members. The department has a good number of
        publications to its credit which include research papers at international level, review articles, books etc.
        Initially, this department was integral part of Department of Applied Sciences, Humanities & Management which
        used to impart academic instructions to mainly undergraduate students of engineering programs. Now, the
        department has stimulating undergraduate and postgraduate following teaching programmes: B.Sc. (Non-medical)
        M.Sc. Physics (Hons) Integrated M.Sc. (Physics) The department believes in providing quality education to the
        students. The students are provided a comprehensive practical exposure to the various instrumental techniques
        required for their further education. The department has good instrumental research facilities such as FT-IR,
        UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, digital LCR meter, Thermoluminescence reader, Muffle furnace, hydraulic press for
        powder compression and good computer facility for carrying out advanced research. The department is actively
        involved in organizing activities like Conferences/ Workshops/ Symposium from time to time. Besides, faculty is
        actively involved in guiding Ph.D. students and development activities in the form of executing projects funded
        by external agencies.
        The department has its own well equipped laboratories for students of undergraduate (B.Tech., B.Sc.) and
        post-graduate (M.Sc.-Physics) programs. To list a few, we have equipment like He-Ne laser kit, Ultrasonic
        Interferometers, Spectrometers, Modulation and demodulation of Optical signals, Set-up for intensity response of
        solar cells and Photodiode, Opto-electronic kits consisting of LDR, VDR, photodiode, LED, Zener diode, Set-up
        for V-I characteristics of PN diodes, Melde's electric vibrator, Four-probe method for band gap engineering,
        Composite Piezo-electric oscillator set-up, Hall Effect Set-up, Logic gates, J K Flip flop, MUX kit, DEMUX kit,
        Michelson's Interferometer, Hysteresis-loop tracer for magnetic materials, Impedance analyzer etc. Hands-on
        practice in physics laboratories gives students an opportunity to experience real world phenomenon and to
        understand the basic fundamentals of physics.</p>
    <h5>Maths Introduction</h5>
    <p>Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us,
        in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices,
        computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering and even sports.

        Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized
        society, and math has been used by even the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose
        because of the increasingly complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced
        mathematical solutions, as outlined by mathematician Raymond L. Wilder in his book "Evolution of Mathematical
        Concepts(opens in new tab)" (Dover Publications, 2013).

        The more complex a society, the more complex the mathematical needs. Primitive tribes needed little more than
        the ability to count, but also used math to calculate the position of the sun and the physics of hunting. "All
        the records — anthropological and historical — show that counting and, ultimately, numeral systems as a device
        for counting form the inception of the mathematical element in all cultures," Wilder wrote in 1968.

        WHO INVENTED MATHEMATICS?
        Several civilizations — in China, India, Egypt, Central America and Mesopotamia — contributed to mathematics as
        we know it today. The Sumerians, who lived in the region that is now southern Iraq, were the first people to
        develop a counting system with a base 60 system, according to Wilder.

        This was based on using the bones in the fingers to count and then use as sets, according to Georges Ifrah in
        his book "The Universal History Of Numbers(opens in new tab)" (John Wiley & Sons, 2000). From these systems we
        have the basis of arithmetic, which includes basic operations of addition, multiplication, division, fractions
        and square roots. Wilder explained that the Sumerians' system passed through the Akkadian Empire to the
        Babylonians around 300 B.C. Six hundred years later, in Central America, the Maya developed elaborate calendar
        systems and were skilled astronomers. About this time, the concept of zero was developed in India.

        As civilizations developed, mathematicians began to work with geometry, which computes areas, volumes and
        angles, and has many practical applications. Geometry is used in everything from home construction to fashion
        and interior design. As Richard J. Gillings wrote in his book "Mathematics in the Time of the Pharaohs(opens in
        new tab)" (Dover Publications, 1982), the pyramids of Giza in Egypt are stunning examples of ancient
        civilizations' advanced use of geometry.

        (opens in new tab)
        Geometry went hand in hand with algebra. Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī authored the
        earliest recorded work on algebra called "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"
        around 820 A.D., according to Philip K. Hitti(opens in new tab), a history professor at Princeton and Harvard
        University. Al-Khwārizmī also developed quick methods for multiplying and dividing numbers, which are known as
        algorithms — a corruption of his name, which in Latin was translated to Algorithmi.

        Algebra offered civilizations a way to divide inheritances and allocate resources. The study of algebra meant
        mathematicians could solve linear equations and systems, as well as quadratics, and delve into positive and
        negative solutions. Mathematicians in ancient times also began to look at number theory, which "deals with
        properties of the whole numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …," Tom M. Apostol, a professor at the California Institute of
        Technology, wrote in "Introduction to Analytic Number Theory(opens in new tab)" (Springer, 1976). With origins
        in the construction of shape, number theory looks at figurate numbers, the characterization of numbers, and
        theorems.

        MATHEMATICS IN ANCIENT GREECE
        The word mathematics comes from the ancient Greeks and is derived from the word máthēma, meaning "that which is
        learnt," according to Douglas R. Harper, author of the "Online Etymology Dictionary(opens in new tab)." The
        ancient Greeks built on other ancient civilizations’ mathematical studies, and they developed the model of
        abstract mathematics through geometry.

        Greek mathematicians were divided into several schools, as outlined by G. Donald Allen, professor of Mathematics
        at Texas A&M University in his paper, "The Origins of Greek Mathematics(opens in new tab)":

        In addition to the Greek mathematicians listed above, a number of other ancient Greeks made an indelible mark on
        the history of mathematics, including Archimedes, most famous for the Archimedes' principle around the buoyant
        force; Apollonius, who did important work with parabolas; Diophantus, the first Greek mathematician to recognize
        fractions as numbers; Pappus, known for his hexagon theorem; and Euclid, who first described the golden ratio.

        The golden ratio is one of the most famous irrational numbers; it goes on forever and can’t be expressed
        accurately without infinite space.

        During this time, mathematicians began working with trigonometry, which studies relationships between the sides
        and angles of triangles and computes trigonometric functions, including sine, cosine, tangent and their
        reciprocals. Trigonometry relies on the synthetic geometry developed by Greek mathematicians like Euclid. In
        past cultures, trigonometry was applied to astronomy(opens in new tab) and the computation of angles in the
        celestial sphere.

        The development of mathematics was taken on by the Islamic empires, then concurrently in Europe and China,
        according to Wilder. Leonardo Fibonacci was a medieval European mathematician and was famous for his theories on
        arithmetic, algebra and geometry. The Renaissance led to advances that included decimal fractions, logarithms
        and projective geometry. Number theory was greatly expanded upon, and theories like probability and analytic
        geometry ushered in a new age of mathematics, with calculus at the forefront.

        DEVELOPMENT OF CALCULUS
        In the 17th century, Isaac Newton in England and Gottfried Leibniz in Germany independently developed the
        foundations for calculus, Carl B. Boyer, a science historian, explained in "The History of the Calculus and Its
        Conceptual Development(opens in new tab)" (Dover Publications, 1959). Calculus development went through three
        periods: anticipation, development and rigorization.

        In the anticipation stage, mathematicians attempted to use techniques that involved infinite processes to find
        areas under curves or maximize certain qualities. In the development stage, Newton and Leibniz brought these
        techniques together through the derivative (the curve of mathematical function) and integral (the area under the
        curve). Though their methods were not always logically sound, mathematicians in the 18th century took on the
        rigorization stage and were able to justify their methods and create the final stage of calculus. Today, we
        define the derivative and integral in terms of limits.

        In contrast to calculus, which is a type of continuous mathematics (dealing with real numbers), other
        mathematicians have taken a more theoretical approach. Discrete mathematics is the branch of math that deals
        with objects that can assume only distinct, separated value, as mathematician and computer scientist Richard
        Johnsonbaugh explained in "Discrete Mathematics(opens in new tab)" (Pearson, 2017). Discrete objects can be
        characterized by integers, rather than real numbers. Discrete mathematics is the mathematical language of
        computer science, as it includes the study of algorithms. Fields of discrete mathematics include combinatorics,
        graph theory and the theory of computation.

        WHY MATHEMATICS IS IMPORTANT
        It's not uncommon for people to wonder what relevance mathematics serves in their daily lives. In the modern
        world, math such as applied mathematics is not only relevant, it's crucial. Applied mathematics covers the
        branches that study the physical, biological or sociological world.

        "The goal of applied mathematics is to establish the connections between separate academic fields," wrote Alain
        Goriely in "Applied Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction(opens in new tab)" (Oxford University Press, 2018).
        Modern areas of applied math include mathematical physics, mathematical biology, control theory, aerospace
        engineering and math finance. Not only does applied math solve problems, but it also discovers new problems or
        develops new engineering disciplines, Goriely added. The common approach in applied math is to build a
        mathematical model of a phenomenon, solve the model and develop recommendations for performance improvement.

        While not necessarily an opposite to applied mathematics, pure mathematics is driven by abstract problems,
        rather than real-world problems. Much of the subjects that are pursued by pure mathematicians have their roots
        in concrete physical problems, but a deeper understanding of these phenomena brings about problems and
        technicalities.

        These abstract problems and technicalities are what pure mathematics attempts to solve, and these attempts have
        led to major discoveries for humankind, including the universal Turing machine, theorized by Alan Turing in
        1937. This machine, which began as an abstract idea, later laid the groundwork for the development of modern
        computers. Pure mathematics is abstract and based in theory, and is thus not constrained by the limitations of
        the physical world.

        According to Goriely, "Applied mathematics is to pure mathematics, what pop music is to classical music." Pure
        and applied are not mutually exclusive, but they are rooted in different areas of math and problem solving.
        Though the complex math involved in pure and applied mathematics is beyond the understanding of most people, the
        solutions developed from the processes have affected and improved the lives of many.
